# Gesture-Controlled-5-DOF-Robotic-Arm-using-Computer-Vision
This is the code for my "Gesture Controlled 5 DOF Robotic Arm using Computer Vision" project. I created a gesture-controlled, 3D-printable, 5-degrees-of-freedom, desktop-sized robotic arm. The robotic arm is actuated using three standard servos and two micro servos. The arm is able to mimic human arm movements, which are detected using the Python OpenCV library. The PWM signals of the servos are processed in Python and sent to an Arduino Uno via serial.

The following is a demo video of this project:
